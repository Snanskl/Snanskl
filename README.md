### Hello, I'm Minou! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm currently on a journey to master the art of Business Intelligence with a solid foundation in C# programming.


**About Me:**
- My journey in the world of IT began in early 2022 when I was introduced to C# programming. This led to the creation of multiple desktop applications for my university course, sparking my curiosity for technology.
- Since my first "Hello World!" program, I've been exploring various IT areas to find my niche. That's when I discovered Business Intelligence, a field that perfectly aligns with my interests.
- I'm currently delving deeper into business analysis and discovering the problem-solving approaches essential in the business world, and I must say this path is everything I hoped for.

**What You'll Find Here:**
- C# Projects: You'll find a collection of C# projects, ranging from simple console applications to more complex and challenging ones. These projects reflect my journey and growth in programming.
- Power BI Projects: As I study "SystemfÃ¶rstÃ¥else och verksamhetsprocesser," I'm sharing my Power BI projects here. It's a space where I'm honing my BI skills.
- SQL Projects: In my free time, I'm exploring SQL to understand its functions and its role in connecting with Power BI.
